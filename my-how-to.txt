Follow these steps and you will see the full magic! ✨

--- STEP 1: Wake up the Pretty Pictures! (Monitoring) ---
1. Open your terminal.
2. Type this and press Enter:
   docker-compose up -d

--- STEP 2: Start your Pretend Website! (The Backend) ---
1. Open a NEW terminal window.
2. Type this and press Enter:
   cargo run --example mock_backend

--- STEP 3: Give the Proxy its Secret Key! ---
1. Open ANOTHER new terminal window.
2. We need to give the Proxy a "Secret Key" so it can sign the price quotes.
3. Type this and press Enter:
   $env:PROXY_BLOCKCHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY="ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80"
4. Now, in the SAME window, start the Proxy:
   cargo run --bin reverse-proxy

--- STEP 4: Test it with a Remote Control! (The Client) ---
1. Open ONE MORE terminal window.
2. Type this to run the test:
   cargo run --example rust_example
3. NOW it will work! You will see:
   - "Quote received" (The Proxy signed it!)
   - "Response Body: Hello..." (The Proxy letting you through!)

--- STEP 5: See the Magic Dashboard! ---
1. Open your web browser.
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000
3. The "Reverse Proxy Dashboard" will now be there waiting for you!  (Since I fixed the automatic importer).
4. Look at the charts to see the spikes in the lines! 📈
